- if you remove node_modules from .gitignore and try to PR it, I WILL HUNT YOU FOR ETERNITY DO NOT EVER DO THAT
- regular CSS is lame, use Tailwind and DaisyUI (run the command `npx tailwindcss -o built.css --watch` to autobuild whenever you add classes)
- uhhhhhhhhh like test your code or something before submitting pull requests
