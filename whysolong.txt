whysolong.txt - an explanation as to why you have to wait long enough to grow a full beard

This project uses Puppeteer (https://pptr.dev) to scrape results from various research sites.
The way Puppeteer works is that it opens a new Chrome window in the background and opens each site on it. You don't see this window ever, because Puppeteer is running in 'Headless' mode (no visible window)
Once each site is opened, we need to bypass Cloudflare's anti-bot and ddos protection service. This only adds time if we get flagged which happens sometimes if you consistently use for a while (chances should be MUCH MUCH lower as of 18 nov 2023)
When the site is opened, we need to wait for all of the content to load. This is the main speed bottleneck. The amount of time this takes varies based on your system specs, because remember all we're really doing is opening a bunch of Chrome tabs.
When the content is loaded, we take the first 100 search results (or all of them if theres <100), extract their title and DOI, then send it off as JSON. This doesn't take very long.
Finally, a result card is added to the page which happens in the blink of an eye. or two. or three.
TLDR  the reason it takes so long is that we are opening 4 chrome tabs at once and parsing all of their data at once. 
TLDR 2: faster computer = wait less
